For almost ten years I taught and certified over one thousand people from the ages of 12 to 65 and safely logged over 5,000 dives. But my students taught me something as well. I learned the value and meaning of Quality of Life. In 2005 I moved back to PA and  dedicated myself to serving our older adult community as a resident aide in a personal care home. It was there I learned something else, that people, no matter what theyâ€™re age, gender or race still have the desire to learn new things and have quality and meaning in their daily life. In 2011 I received my C.N.A. certification through Marywood University and began working in Skilled Nursing Centers. While working as a C.N.A. it became clear to me that our senior population was being wonderfully cared for medically by the nurses and aides, but mental, physical, spiritual, social and emotional needs were the responsibility of the activities department. In 2015 I became a certified Activity Director with a mission to bring meaningful quality activities to our older adult population; finding purpose, dignity  and pride in what they can still learn to do and accomplish."</i></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, '', NULL),
